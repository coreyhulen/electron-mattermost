#Github Workflow

When community members step into our repository, it should be:
- Easy to find issues through proper labels,
- Easy to understand what the status of their PR is once submitted, and
- Easy to find ways to contribute to the project

Each issue will have clear labels on what categories they belong to, and what stage a pull request (PR) is at.

### Labels for Version
version/1.4
version/3.4
etc.

### Labels for type of work
type/bug
type/enhancement
type/experimental
type/feature
type/performance
type/question 

### Labels for priority
priority/P0 (top priority)
priority/P1
priority/P2
priority/P3

### Labels for Pull Request Stages
stage/1-design-review
stage/2-code-review
stage/3-testing
stage/4-doc-review  
stage/5-merged
